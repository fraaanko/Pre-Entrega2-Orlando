                <p>From countless millennia worth of war amongst Earth's population, the bloodshed lead to the planet's God Tree absorbing it to subsequently grow a Chakra Fruit, which was forbidden for humans to touch. The God Tree was revered by some cultures; humans used to worship it as a sacred pillar that extended into the heavens and remained ambivalent to all conflict. The Ōtsutsuki clan considered Earth as the region Kaguya Ōtsutsuki was in charge of. Arriving to the planet with a portion of the clan in search for fruit of the God Tree, she ate it, resulting in her manifesting chakra which she used to bring an end to the constant wars. Afterwards, she had twin sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, whom were the first humans born with chakra.</p>
